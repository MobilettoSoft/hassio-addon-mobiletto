        Other methods are available for experienced users for their specific needs, for example, running Home Assistant in a virtualized
        environment (e.g. Proxmox), or on top of an existing operating system (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux): 
      options:
        - Home Assistant Operating System
        - Home Assistant Container
        - Home Assistant Core
        - Home Assistant Supervised
